## Dataset

This project is a step to step process on how to use python for data analysis.

The purpose of this project is to check whether amount of  salary one receives is influenced by one's gender,education level,job title and years of experience.

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from kaggle datasets.

Here is the link to access the data <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veronikanikaaa/salary-data-based-on-country-and-race/data>.

Python libraries will be utilized for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

The aim of this project is to analyze salary distribution based on education level, race, country, years of experience, age, and gender

## STEPS INVOLVED

The first step is to: Create a virtual env.

                     Install requirements.
For anyone who would like to work on a similar projects,the requirements on the necessary python  libraries to use are found  in the (requirements.txt) under this repository.

## PYTHON LIBRARIES TO USE

1.Pandas

The Pandas library will be used to load the dataset from a csv file.

Some functions used when cleaning  data.

Calculate summary statistics.

2.Numpy.

Numpy to perform basic mathematical calculations in python.

3.Matplotlib

Matplotlib is used to visualize data such as generating scatterplots,bar charts,histograms and line plots.

4.Seaborn

Seaborn library is also used to visualize data.

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

The first step involves importing the above mentioned libraries.

Before that,one has to install python libraries to the terminal using the command (pip install pandas).

Loading the dataset from its csv file to vscode.

Data cleaning:Handling missing data,inconsistencies in the data and correcting wrong data.

Data transformation:Converting the data into a more suitable format for analysis.This process will involve normalizing the data,standardizing the data and grouping the data into various categories if necessary.

Data analysis:This process will involve performing descriptive analysis so as to better understand the data,exploratory data analysis to test hypotheses and linear regression and correlation to test whether there exists a relationship between the dependent variable(salary) and the independent variables(education level, race, country, years of experience, age and gender).

Data Visualization will involve presenting the findings of the project in form of graphs and charts.

## NOTEBETTER!

I used Jupyter Notebooks as my Integrated Development Environment.

This is an opensource project and you are welcome to contribute and improve my work.
