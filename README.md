# WELCOME

This project is a step to step process on how to use python for data analysis.

I am going to utilise python libraries to clean the data,data transformation,data analysis and data visualization.

The aim of this project is to see how salary is distributed ,based on education level, race, country, years of experience, age and gender.

## STEPS INVOLVED

The first step is to: Create a virtual env.

                     Install requirements.
For anyone who would like to work on a similar projects,the requirements on the necessary python  libraries to use are found  in the (requirements.txt) under this repository.

## PYTHON LIBRARIES TO USE

1.Pandas

The Pandas library is used to load the dataset from a csv file.

Some functions used when cleaning  data.

Calculate summary statistics.

2.Numpy.

Numpy performs basic mathematical calculations in python.

3.Matplotlib

This library is useful when visualizing data.

Using matplotlib,one can generate scatterplots,bar charts,histograms and line plots so as to visualize data.

4.Seaborn

Seaborn library is also used to visualize data.

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

The first step involves importing the above mentioned libraries.

Loading the dataset from its csv file.

Data cleaning:Handling missing data,inconsistencies in the data and correcting wrong data.

Data transformation:Converting the data into a more suitable format for analysis.This process involves normalizing the data,standardizing the data and grouping the data into various categories if necessary.

Data analysis:This process will involve performing descriptive analysis so as to better understand the data,exploratory data analysis to test hypotheses and linear regression and correlation to test whether there exists a relationship between the dependent variable(salary) and the independent variables(education level, race, country, years of experience, age and gender).

Data Visualization:Data visualization is an important process because it one can present the findings of the project in form of graphs and charts.This way,one is able to better understand the findings and gain insights from the data.

## NOTEBETTER!

I used Jupyter Notebooks as my Integrated Development Environment.

This is an opensource project and you are welcome to contribute and improve my work.

You can reach me via my email address (ivymwai6@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

Thank you!

Let's get into it!
